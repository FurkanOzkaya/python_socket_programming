# # Basic Socket with AsyncIO Example with Python


## How to Run:
Run server first

```
py server.py
```
Check message in client.py and run.

```
py client.py
```

I prefer to use asyncIO instead thread. Here you can learn what is [AsyncIO](https://furkanozkaya.com/software-languages/asyncio-nedir-nasil-kullanilir/).
